# Org Chart API

A **RESTful API** built with [Drogon](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon), a high-performance C++ framework. This API is designed to manage organizational structures, including persons, departments, and job roles.

üîê **All routes are protected using JWT for token-based authentication**.

## üß™ Unit Test Generator

This project includes an AI-assisted Unit Test Generator for C++ Drogon applications. The generator uses GitHub Copilot and a structured approach to create, refine, and analyze test coverage for the API.

### üìù Test Generation Approach

The test generator implements a multi-stage approach:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Automatically scans controller files to identify endpoints and routes
2. **Prompt Generation**: Creates AI-ready prompts for GitHub Copilot
3. **Test Generation**: Produces two types of tests:
   - **Template-based tests**: Detailed tests with specific assertions
   - **Stub tests**: Simplified tests that compile without external dependencies

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Components

The test generator consists of:

1. **`generate_tests.cpp`**: C++ generator script that:
   - Scans the codebase for controllers and API endpoints
   - Creates AI-ready prompts
   - Generates test files from templates

2. **`test_generation_config.yaml`**: Configuration file defining:
   - Test framework (Drogon)
   - Coverage targets
   - Assertion types
   - Test case categories

3. **`test_template.txt`**: Template for generating structured test cases

### üìä Test Coverage Results

The generated tests achieved:
- 100% coverage of test code (71/71 lines)
- 40.6% coverage of Drogon core components
- 17.3% overall project coverage (4,806/27,786 lines)

### üöÄ How to Use the Test Generator

1. **Build the Test Generator**:
   ```bash
   g++ generate_tests.cpp -o generate_tests
   ```

2. **Run the Generator**:
   ```bash
   ./generate_tests
   ```

3. **Review and Refine Generated Tests**:
   - Examine the generated test files in the `test/` directory
   - Use GitHub Copilot to complete test implementations

4. **Run the Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
   make
   ./test/unittest
   ```

5. **Generate Coverage Report**:
   ```bash
   cd build
   lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
   genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_report
   ```

### üê≥ Testing with Docker

For a consistent testing environment, use the provided Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t org-chart-tests .
docker run -it org-chart-tests
```

This will build the project, run all tests, and generate a coverage report.

### üìã Test Categories

The generator creates tests for:
- **Positive Cases**: Verify correct behavior with valid inputs
- **Negative Cases**: Verify error handling with invalid inputs
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

### üîç Controllers Tested

1. **AuthController**:
   - Register user endpoint
   - Login user endpoint
   
2. **DepartmentsController**:
   - List departments
   - Get department by ID
   - Create department
   
3. **PersonsController**:
   - List people
   - Get person by ID
   - Create/update/delete person

## üì¶ Two Ways to Get Started

There are two ways to run the project:

### 1. **Using Docker** (Recommended for ease of setup)

Docker simplifies the setup process and ensures all dependencies are handled automatically.

### 2. **Manual Setup** (For those who prefer to run the project locally)  
Follow these steps if you want to run the application without Docker, but make sure to install dependencies and configure everything manually.

---

## üê≥ Using Docker

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/orgChartApi.git
cd orgChartApi
````

**2. Start the Docker Containers:**

Run the following command to bring up the services (PostgreSQL and the app):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**3. Confirm Containers are Running:**

Check the status of your containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see two containers running: one for the PostgreSQL database and one for the application.

**4. Access the Application:**

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can now interact with the API using any HTTP client.

### Note: Once the Application has started, See the usage guide to see how to interact with the application.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Manual Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer to manually set up the project, follow these steps.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* Git
* GCC and G++
* CMake
* PostgreSQL
* OpenSSL
* libjsoncpp-dev
* Other dependencies (listed below)


### üì• Install Dependencies

**For Ubuntu**, run the following commands to install necessary tools:

```bash
sudo apt install git gcc g++ cmake
sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev     # jsoncpp
sudo apt install uuid-dev           # uuid
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev         # zlib
sudo apt install openssl libssl-dev # OpenSSL 
sudo apt-get install postgresql-all # PostgreSQL (for DB support)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Install database libraries **before** installing Drogon to avoid errors.

### üêâ Drogon Installation

Now, let's install Drogon:

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd $WORK_PATH
git clone https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon
cd drogon
git submodule update --init
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
```

### ‚úÖ Verify Drogon Installation

Once Drogon is installed, you can verify it with:

```bash
drogon_ctl -v
```

You should see the Drogon version and other relevant information.

---

**Important:**  

There are **two changes in the Application** you need to make when setting it up manually:

1. **Change the hostname** from `db` to `localhost` in the `config.json` file.
2. **Change the port** from `5432` to `5433` in the `config.json` file.


## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. **Start PostgreSQL**

To start the PostgreSQL database locally:

```bash
docker run --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d -p 5433:5432 postgres
```

**2. Install Postgres Client:**

If you don‚Äôt have the PostgreSQL client installed, run:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

**3. Create the Database:**

Log into PostgreSQL and create the `org_chart` database:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5433/'
CREATE DATABASE org_chart;
```

**4. Seed the Database:**

Run the following SQL files to set up the necessary tables:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5433/org_chart' -f scripts/create_db.sql
psql 'postgresql://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5433/org_chart' -f scripts/seed_db.sql
```

## üèóÔ∏è Build the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/orgChartApi.git 
cd orgChartApi
git submodule update --init
```

### 2. **Build the Project:**

To build the project, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

Once the project is built, ensure that the `config.json` file is correctly configured with your database settings, then run the application:

```bash
./org_chart
```

The app will now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## üí° Usage Guide

### 1. **Register a User:**

Install [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) if you haven‚Äôt already:

```bash
sudo apt install httpie
```

To register a new user, run:

```bash
http post localhost:3000/auth/register username="admin1" password="password"
```
(or)

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin1","password":"password"}'

```

You will receive a JWT token as the response:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "username": "admin1"
}
```

### 2. **Login:**

To log in and receive a token:

```bash
http post localhost:3000/auth/login username="admin1" password="password"
```

The response will look like:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "username": "admin1"
}
```

### 3. **Access Protected Resources:**

Use the JWT token to access protected endpoints:

```bash
http --auth-type=bearer --auth="your_jwt_token" get localhost:3000/persons offset==1 limit==25 sort_field==id sort_order==asc
```

Sample response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "first_name": "Gary",
    "last_name": "Reed",
    "hire_date": "2018-04-07 01:00:00",
    "job": {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "M1"
    },
    "department": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Product"
    },
    "manager": {
      "id": 1,
      "full_name": "Sabryna Peers"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```
